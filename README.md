## Instructions

I was using the starter Code from Udacity to start building the memory game. Additionally I used [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) for the popup modal for the winning and restart message.

The can be played on large and mobile screens as I added some mobile styling as well.

## How to Play

Find matching pairs through clicking the cards. If you open two cards, it will count as one move.
You will win the game, if you finish it with 3 stars (less then 12 moves). 
If you have between 13 and 18 moves, you will earn 2 stars and if you have more moves, there is one star waiting for you.

Have fun!
